Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=627829,"  Borrower added on 12/05/10 > This is my story.<br/><br/>I am looking for a loan to simply consolidate my dept. I personally consider credit a privilege and I handle all of my obligations with great responsibility. The climate of the current credit market has changed, effecting people like myself in a negative manner. Let me explain. Recently my credit score was impacted greatly by some of my credit grantors reduction in credit exposure. This has affected my credit score in an amount of close to 100 bases points. So I went from 760 avg. credit score to around 670, strictly due to my credit grantor fears of the credit market. I haven&rsquo;t been late with a single payment to any of my credit sources in at least the last 7 years and a simple peering into my credit reports can easily prove that. There are many people like myself who have suffered from this market stimulated fear, justifiably or not.<br/><br/>It started with chase. I have two chase visa accounts both of which carry a balance. On one card I carried a balance of 2k with an 8k limit. On the other I carried 4k with an 11k limit. Chase pinged my accounts and discovered that I was making only minimal payments and decided to reduce my limits to just above my balances. This effected the ratio of balance to available credit, resulting to a negative credit factor, lowing score. Then Citi followed suite, taking my 20k available limit down to my 6k balance. Again this was a negative hit on my rating and score. There was nothing that I had done to prompt this action, they did it simply by choosing and to me that is their right. It is their money at risk, so I don&rsquo;t have any problems with that. What I do have some difficulty with is that they negatively affected me with out provocation but let&rsquo;s move on.<br/><br/>I am fifty years old and employed at a stable company and have been for the last 18 years. My base pay is 65k. or 80k with overtime. I own three pieces of real state, one I personally reside in, the other two for income. One I owned before the mortgage meltdown and it operates a -$200.00 a month in the red, the other I acquired after and it operates +$1300 a month in the black. Something a credit grantor like the ones mentioned above should have taken the time to find out because that is an extra 13k a year in income.  But that is what happens when there is no personal touch.<br/><br/>The process of taking some of that income and paying off my debt is obvious. But some of my debt is associated with the cost of rehab work on one of my properties. I would like to refinance and roll the debt in but I haven&rsquo;t had the property long enough and my current credit score is hindering. This is why I have opted to try for a loan to consolidate my debt which would immediately boost my credit score back to the levels I once maintained.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I am seeking 15k medium term with a reasonable interest rate with no prepayment penalty to begin this process.<br/><br/>Thank you all for your time and consideration.<br/>",debt_consolidation,consolidate ,604xx,IL,10.01,0,Mar-90,700,704,6,,,16,0,41575,79.60%,32,f,0,0,14220.41328,14184.86,10000,4220.41,0,0,0,15-Dec,236.82,16-Jan,15-Dec,554,550,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

This is my first time applying for a loan at this type of lender.  I am not really sure I have filled out everything properly. The screen indicates n/a under employment which should be explained if I am asking people to invest in me.  I am receiving  Social Security and  I am living with my parents for now which means my monthly living expenses are very low.  I am not dying and will be around to pay back my entire loan ...so please do not worry about that.  I started working when I was 15 years old and always worked until  I suffered some unexpected problems with my health.  Originally I applied for a smaller loan amount because I wasnted to pay of two credit cards  I received when I first started to establish credit.  I guess I was considered a risk with no credit history and I paid an application fee and they charge me an annual fee every month on my statement.   I called them because I feel  I have proven my worthiness and asked for a better card that I could transfer my balance over to with no annual fee.   The offered me a secon card that still charges a large annual fee but rewards me with a few pennies for every dollar I charge on that card.     When I submitted my application here the screen said I was pre approved and could chage my request a higher loan amount they showed on the screen.  I decided I would apply   for a large enough loan to pay off all my debts and have just one monthly payment and be done with credit.   If this loan is funded I plan on making higher payments every month to pay it off sooner and be done with it!  I am not sure if that is good or bad for some one investing in this loan.... but you deserve to know what my intentions are before you make a decision.

Both auto loans have been paid in full but are not yet marked paid on my credit report.

I already paid for the ring and wedding dress out of my own pocket, so this money will be use to pay for the reception and for the pictures .I believe I&rsquo;m a great borrow because I have a low Dti ratio and I been making all my payments on time for the past couple years without any late payment.

My delinquencies happen because of misunderstanding between me and my student loan creditor. I was suppose to be in forbearance period  while I attended school, but I found out later while attending summer classes that  by only taking 2 summer classes  it was not consider full time and I was unaware of this until was to late. Bottom line is that I was responsible to check the agreement contract and I failed to do so I that time. I was a college student a bit na&iuml;ve and I didn&rsquo;t realize how important was to maintain good credit. I realize I made a mistake and I quickly took action and solve the problem as soon as I was aware of the mistake. I learned from that mistake and I made a priority to make sure that  won&rsquo;t happen again, because I realize how important it is to keep a good credit history and I been showing that but making sure I make my monthly payments on time and being finically responsible.<br/>Please help fund my loan and if you guys have any question for me regarding my posting please feel free to ask. <br/><br/>Thank you very much,<br/>   <br/><br/>My monthly expenses are as follows:<br/><br/>Car payment: $193/month.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions.<br/> Borrower added on 10/04/10 > I would like to clarify that although it shows that I was delinquent on a payment 2 years ago, this is an error. When the Credit management company took over, I was told to make my regular payments up to a specific date where they would take over. They told me they communicated with all my creditors but apparently they were late in dispersing payment to one creditor. I was up to date with my payments to my creditors and to the credit management program, but it looks as if I missed a payment when in fact I was on time with all my payments. I've tried to dispute this several times, and I've been unsuccessful in removing this false delinquent hit to my credit report. I don't know what else to do about it.<br/><br/>Please rest assured that I make all my payments on time to all my creditors. I also pay all my utilities, cable, internet and cell phone on time as well. According to my Experian Report (which I get twice a month) my score with them is at 719, and I have a consistent on time payment history. <br/><br/>Thank you again to everyone who is funding my loan. I'm very appreciative.<br/> Borrower added on 10/04/10 > I would also like to add that I was a full time student at the time that I applied for and utilized these credit cards. I was dependent on them at the time but the interest rates were high and I could not keep up with the payments because I was in college. <br/><br/>I put them on the credit management program because I didn't want to be late and ruin my credit and I wanted the interest rates to drop. Although the program was helpful, and the interest rates are quite low, it is hindering my ability to move forward. I want to clean my credit profile and elevate it.  I also feel that having this new loan from Lending Club (as opposed to 4 credit cards with low interest on a credit management plan) will be a good and smart way to improve my score over the long run as I make consistent monthly payments.<br/> Borrower added on 10/06/10 > I really am looking forward to having this loan fully funded.

I got some help from other sources but still it was not enough.  So now I guess this is why my rate is so high.   I would like to thank you for your interest in my loan application and my needs.

Someday maybe I can become an invester too.  It would give me a feeling of great warmth  and satisfaction to help others like you are doing.  Having to depend on others to help is embarrassing and scarey so unsure if I am worthy. So I will not forget this awful time and I will know what others are feeling and I will help once I get back on my feet and are able to do so.

I began CPR and told him come back to us please! After awhile and the code was called. It was great! He did come back.  He was weak but back to normal sinus rythme. He was then sent to CCU to be examined for a pacemaker defect.   I was shaking.  I called my mother and she cheered me on.  His wife hugged me and it was so wonderful that I could give him back to her.  That's why I would never leave my job that feeling and of course it is a steady income and security, for me to be a good risk to pay back my bills.  I do make a good living it was just the leave that put me behind I only got a small % of my normal income @ this time. And you may think because I am a medical employee there would be no medical or medicine bills but unfortunately this is not true at all.  I am so glad to be back at work though so I can get my steady income of approx. 2000$ a month, more if I can do overtime.  It is also good to now share the expenses with a roommate, this will help me to get caught up as well as this loan I am hoping to receive.

In addition, this option is much more cost  efficient as compared to that afforded by monthly revolving credit payment schedule. <br/><br/>I am a Business Executive / Professional employed in the Information Technology Sector by a firm that has been in business for 37 years.  <br/><br/>Like most I have learned to hate Credit Card companies.  I have been a customer of credit card companies for many years and been a perfect customer for each.  Always on time and never late on my payments to them.  Then one day out of the blue I interest rates increase.  Driven by the credit card companies mismanagement of their own business.  The consumer ends up paying the price.<br/> Borrower added on 08/26/10 > As these credit card companies raised their interest rates I made the same mistake many make by getting sucked into the shell game of 0% interest balance transfers.  Many of these firms promised APR's of 9.95% to 14% after the expiration of the 0% introductry period.  A few months later, a form letter arrived in the mail stating my interest rate was going to be raised 10 points.  No justification provided.  I contacted a few of these companies to complain.  In some cases they appologized and dropped the interest rate a few points and in other cases their response was more or less &quot;tough luck&quot;.  At that point I made the determination I was not going to do business with a firm that abused its customers.  <br/><br/>Over the last few weeks I have investigated options to circumvent the pure greed of these companies.  I have investigated traditional option like personal loans, etc.  I ran across the Pier to Pier lending option and liked the process.  <br/><br/>I am much more keen to doing business with individual investors who realize investment returns and operate with the same principals as I do.<br/>",debt_consolidation,consolidation,760xx,TX,17.84,0,Aug-92,675,679,4,,,20,0,58489,65.60%,40,f,0,0,32958.05856,32958.06,20825,12133.06,0,0,0,15-Sep,585.32,15-Oct,15-Sep,809,805,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

I greatly appreciate your assistance in getting this funded.  I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding.  <br/>Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.

I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.

(It is more important for me to get bills taken care of than to purchase a bike as a post divorce stress-reliever, even though I think it would have assisted me with some other issues I am currently dealing with.

I have also just finished my masters program in school administration.  My education also added to our debt, however I plan to use my new degree to obtain a higher salary job in education in the near future.   I feel that it is very important to pay off debts as I think it reflects my character.  The 294 that I will pay each month falls into our monthly budgets.  We pay approx 2000 a month mortgage, 2000 on CC/Bills, and items like groceries and other living expenses take up another 1000 a month.

I have been paying minimum payments to both my credit cards so I have some left to help my parents. They are both having health problems and Im helping them since for a couple of years now.   My dad is 89 years old and has dementia.  My mom, 79, has diabetes and cant walk anymore. I realized if I could pay off or consolidate my debts, I could give more to my parents.  I already have saved college fund for my teenager son (17 yrs) and that relieved me in some expenses.  He will be in his senior high school but will take basic college studies in the coming school year.  <br/>I am very appreciative and thankful for the investors that are helping me out.  I still feel lucky that I have a job so I could help my family.

The purpose for this loan is debt consolidation.  Since my wife was diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago, we have run up debts as she was unable to work.  Now that she is cancer free and back at work full time, our #1 goal is becoming debt free for our future.  We are both in our 40s and have never missed a payment on our mortgage or our credit.  We are both professionals with very stable jobs (combined income $150K), and are just looking to get our finances back on the right track.  Consolidating all of our debts into one loan with a 5-year payoff is a big step for us achieving our goals.

It is for her (and my 11 year-old son, who is my best friend) that I seek this loan to eliminate our debts so we can move forward and begin funding our futures.

I have credit cards and medical bills that I need to consolidate into one loan and somewhat lower interest rate in order to comfortably be able to pay and meet every loans expectations. I want to honor the debit AND to pay it off as quickly as possible. I have had folks tell me to not pay the hospital and for me frankly that is not honorable or morally right. So I am looking for solutions to pay comfortably and to pay fully.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower? I am dedicated to honesty and doing the right thing. I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget? I have about 5 credit cards and two bank loans and one large loan to the hospital. I have the obvious mortgage, auto loan and insurance, household mthly (electric, gas, water, etc). I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process. My previous job I was at for 18+ years and there to held a high position. That job was extremely stressful in location as well as duties since I worked a contract for the Department of Defense in Homeland Security. So I needed to make healthier choices and IMS heard I was looking and picked me up right away. I feel I will be at IMS forever, no doubt, well ok, until I retire.

During my schooling, bills have gradually increased, but now I will be able to take care of them faster now that I can work full time and look for a better paying job that is applicable to my field of study. My father has owned his business for over 27 years repairing street cars. He has turned it into a multi million dollar business that will always secure a job for me if the work market fails. He allows me to get all the over time that I'm willing to sacrifice my time for, in which case I usually put in over 50 hours a week. In which case, my checks average 380 a week. Also, for every ASE certification I pass, which I plan on passing more, I get a 75 cent raise. So I plan on passing at least 3 more before finding a better paying job in my field, which will make my weekly payment that much more significant.  My rent is only 325.00 a month, utilities are split with two other roomates(averaging about $75 per month, per person). My car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone bills are covered by my parents so I do not carry that financial burden. So two weeks out of the month take care of my living expenses, while the other two weeks can be used to pay off any debt I have. But I am a young, healthy, and physically active man who is motivated to get on top of my debt and savings so I can start a successful life and buy a house within five years.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidating,402xx,KY,13.2,0,6-Sep,675,679,6,,,5,0,4561,76%,6,f,0,0,158.3,158.3,43.48,26.45,0,88.37,0.82,10-Jul,70.27,10-Dec,16-Oct,504,500,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

This is a personal loan request to replace $15,000 that I invested into the purchase of a national commerical real estate brokerage franchise in Houston, TX.  I am now one of three managing partners and the principal broker of the firm.  $10,000 of the loan proceeds will be used as a stop gap or float for the next 90-120 days and $5,000 of the funds will go to payoff 4 credit cards that have APR's over 18%.  I just closed on the purchase of the brokerage franchise last week and I will not start seeing money out of that for at least 60-90 days.  In that same time period, my wife is graduating from college as a Registered Nurse in May and will start adding $40-$50K a year to our household income starting in June.  Because of the timing of all of this, I am left a little light on liquid capital.  I have a small amount of savings and securities but would rather not liquidate those positions.  I also have approximately $60,000 of real equity in two seperate land holdings that I own, but it would take at least 6 months to liquidate one of those land assets.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=491156,"  Borrower added on 03/05/10 > I would like to replace an aging truck. I've owned my current truck for 14 years, and it's nearing the end of its life cycle of about a million miles. I would like to purchase a truck with no more than 500,000 miles and a newer more fuel efficient engine. Since I run locally around Chicago and travel less than 20,000 miles per year, this truck should last me at least another 14 years, or until I decide to get one more efficient. <br/><br/><br/>I've been contracted to the same trucking company for almost 10 years. This company gives work by seniority. I'm 10th out of 21, and of the top ten, 5 will be retiring within 5 years. I've been an independent trucker since 1989, and have been a licensed truck driver since 1985. I make between 1700 and 2200 dollars a week and have between 200 and 350 dollars a week in expenses. My wife makes 2200 dollars a month. I have a great driving record and I am in good health. I own a home, I have a good credit rating, and I'm not about to do anything that might lower my credit score. I have financed and paid for several trucks ranging in price from 13,000 to 33,500 dollars. My financial troubles started  about 15 years ago when I bought 2 more trucks. I just couldn't find any good drivers. The ones I hired only wanted to work a few days a week. They tore up my trucks. They sold my fuel. You name it, they did it...everything but work a full week. So I ran up my credit cards to keep the bills paid. After I sold my other 2 trucks and just depended on me driving, I was able to make progress. 10 years ago I had over 40,000 dollars in credit card debt, and now it's down to 13,500 dollars. I have recently paid off 3 credit cards and will payoff 2 more within 4 months. I have been paying down my credit card debt for years, and now it has started to snowball. As I pay off a card, I add that payment to the next highest balance. I'm paying almost 1100 dollars a month toward my balances. I'll have all my credit cards paid off in just over a year. Becoming debt free has become my life mission! I have never defaulted on any loan in my entire life and I'm not about to start now. I have been approved for a bank loan, but they want me to buy a much newer and much more expensive truck than I need. I would have a much higher credit score, but I closed all of the accounts I paid off. Back then, I had no idea that leaving them open after paying them off would greatly enhance my credit score.<br/> Borrower added on 03/06/10 > Thanks to all of my investors.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=489091,"  Borrower added on 02/25/10 > 1. I am employed by a securities firm with over 2 billion dollars in client assets. My commission is very stable, as it comes from the trading commissions charged to traders whom I helped open brokerage accounts. My commission base is over 500 traders (old ones drop off my payroll after a year); they need not be profitable for the firm (and me) to make money Ã¢Â€Â” just active. Our niche is active traders, and there's always people who want to make money in the market. My job has similar pay at other firms, should I ever (God forbid) be forced to resign.<br/><br/>2. My total household income is about $5000 per month. This is a low-ball figure, as my W-2 for last year showed a little over $73k. The recession that started in 2008 has not affected my business significantly in 2009, but it's best to be cautious, as no one knows what tomorrow will bring. I wish you to make an informed decision based on the following monthly expenses:<br/>	Taxes: $1250<br/>	Mortgage + insurance: $1500<br/>	Food, entertainment, gas, utilities: $700<br/>This leaves at least $1500 discretionary income to service this debt and other spending.<br/><br/>3. Balances:<br/>	Mortage balance: $188,000<br/>	Loans: $10,000 (1500 @ 14%, 3500 @ 30%, 5000 @ 30%)<br/><br/>4. The house was appraised at $199,000 around August 2009. I also own my own car.<br/><br/>5. This loan is to reconcile my debts. I have already started this with a $2300 loan from LC over a year ago. That paid off about 35% of my revolving credit card balances. The rest I achieved on my own. Additionally, I saved for a down payment, acquired a mortage and purchased my own home in August of last year (all the while paying interest on the outstanding loans). With the scrutiny lenders give to borrowers these days, you bet I was financially qualified.<br/>	Additionally, this loan is to pay for other things on which i spend my discretionary income, mostly to fix up the house. I bought a top-of-the-line HVAC which saves 60% on energy costs over traditional models. I also installed hurricane-proof windows, which are not only safe, but insulate the house very well and keep energy costs down (especially in Florida). I have a few other improvements in mind for the next few months. My house is not in a flood region and is 30 minutes from the ocean.<br/><br/>6. I incurred debt when I got out of college and entered the workforce. To start, I made $300 a week and was told i'd make at least $100k/yr in about a year. I thought I'd pay off everything quickly. Fresh out of college with my four-year degree, I lived beyond my means, took out loans and used newly-acquired credit cards. Yet the promised income never materialized. I have since changed to a much more stable profession and learned to get rich slowly. However, I must live with my actions and their consequences. Yes, LC will take 3.75% origination fee, amounting to about $552. My other option is to continue paying an average of 27.6% APR on about $10,000, which is $2760 in interest alone each year. Yearly interest with LC will be approx 504monthly payment x 36months -14725principal / 3years = $1139, which saves $1069 in interest the first year, and about $1621 a year thereafter.<br/><br/>Taking this loan is a smart financial decision.<br/><br/><br/>I've done my homework on this. I am not going to let you down.<br/>",debt_consolidation,You make money while I save on interest,330xx,FL,9.09,0,5-Oct,700,704,4,,,11,0,226,3.40%,14,f,0,0,18174.99385,18174.99,14724.99,3450,0,0,0,13-Mar,551.17,13-Apr,13-Mar,639,635,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.

I CANCELLED THE ORIGINAL LOAN REQUEST AND RAISED MY REQUESTED AMOUNT.  I WAS AMAZED AT THE REPSONSES (THANK YOU) SO I AM GOING TO REQUEST WHAT I REALLY NEED TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON THIS DEAL. I went into business with family. I was 50% co-owner of a truckstop. We built it in 2007. For the first year and a half, my partners stood back and let me run it. I made over $300K with it in 2008. In early 2009, they decided to participate and it went down hill fast. To make a long story short, it went under in Nov. 2009. The landlord, our fuel supplier (Amaroil.com), evicted our company for past due fuel invoice debt. The landlord wishes to re-lease the site to me (because I made us money when I was alone) and understandably wants me to obtain my own working capital to re-enter the business. I cannot qualify for any conventional lending because I have no collateral. Everything I have is tied up in my business. I have one past 30 day hit on my credit record my entire life. All three of my Fico's are over 700. I am married with a 2 year old, I like to hunt and fish in my off time. I have been married for 5 years, and my wife works side by side with me in the business.<br/><br/>Your money will be paid back. Your money will go to good use (working capital). I pay and treat my employees very well, and alot of people are depending on me to get this thing back going. If interested, I can give you the google earth location to see the site for yourself.<br/><br/>Thanks for any consideration.<br/><br/>Craig<br/>Borrower added on 12/29/09 > I wanted to add: Anyone who is a small business operator now days guards their credit with their life.

Both promotional and standard rates ranging from 7.25% - 12.00% have been increased on average to 27%-29.99%, which I'll have to pay beginning in January. I placed a significant amount down on my home, so I have a reasonable amount of equity that I'd like to keep, given the value these days of having a home worth much more than your mortgage. So rather than taking cash out to consolidate this now quite expensive debt, I'm looking to consolidate it with a personal loan. I work in finance, so I know the math works - I save double digits in points on the unsecured debt, and I keep the equity in my home. As you'll see on my application, my DTI is low so I can afford to make the increased monthly payments, but hopefully peer-to-peer will help me get the rate/loan amount that banks won't give in this credit environment.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=456422," 566640 added on 11/01/09 > I have just acquired a running business in Southern California.  The business is retail fragrance stores in the shopping malls.  I am doing business only in high class shopping malls by Simon and General Growth Properties.  One store was opened in July of 2009.  I am about to open a new store before Thanksgiving.  The stores do phenomenal business in November and December.  The purpose of this loan is to have enough cash on hand to complete construction quickly and provide enough inventories to satisfy increased holiday demand.  This is a proven business model.  We carry all high end brand names as well as lesser known promotional fragrances that are very popular among young consumers.  All products are 100% genuine.  The stores are built very bright with the combination of can-lights, pendant lights and back lit posters.  The floors are also very smooth and shiny with Italian mosaic tiles and a right combination of color scheme for the showcases and store shelves.  I have been associated with this business for several years, as many of my acquaintances are in this business for a long time.  The key in this business, as in almost every business in understanding the customer, lower prices, inventory management and location.  Our stores are in very high revenue producing malls and at great locations. 566640 added on 11/01/09 > As in almost all the retail businesses, the holiday season in this business, also generates enough revenues to almost cover the expenses for the rest of the year.  Therefore, with this loan, I plan to speed up the store improvements.  The idea is to stock reasonable levels of inventories and sell at price lower than the big departmental stores.  In todayÃ¢Â€Â™s economy, the consumers are very cost conscious.  The savings of anywhere between $5 to $20 dollars is enough for lure the crowds.  As the new economic data is showing that the economy finally seems to be recovering.  The forecast also mentions that the high-end businesses will not be as successful this holiday season as the discount businesses.  We fully intend to take advantage of this opportunity. 566640 added on 11/01/09 > Thank you.",small_business,New Store Opening Soon,917xx,CA,20.15,0,Aug-87,740,744,4,,,14,0,215175,35%,22,f,0,0,28968.19067,28881.29,25000,3968.19,0,0,0,11-Jan,17557.48,11-Feb,11-Feb,694,690,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

I never even used the card. I also applied for a loan from my credit union about 2 months ago, but I was not employed by Kohls yet and I was turned down.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=446264,"Hello, this is my first attempt at this.  I am so excited, this is a great idea, and soon I will be at the other end of this idea.. lending instead of borrowing.  I have a daughter in college, so instead of her accruing debt, I am.  But it's alright with me, she has a goal of becoming a parole officer, and I am willing to help her get there.  She is in her 3rd year of college at CMU.  So what I need is a place to put my credit card debt from the last two years that I had three car payments and had to keep moving debt to 0% cards.  I will be down to only one car pmt and will be putting the 600.00 pmt plus the 200.00 credit card pmt I have been making towards this loan every month.  If I transfer the money to another 0%, I will have pay 1000.00 anyway for the movement.  So I may as well get a fixed rate and pay the interest monthly to someone I would probably like better anyway!  I always pay my bills, never late, I work every day 6-7 days a week 12 or more hours per day.  I am a consciencious person, who you can trust.  I am 46 years old, my kids are both living on their own, one in his own home with his own fledgling business, {he also works all possible hours}.  I am married to a man who works in the same place I do, same amount of hours.  We just need a temporary loan to get this particular debt knocked out.  I could get about 7500.00 out of my psp, but then that is just another payment out there, and I just want one payment of 800.00. I could actually handle a 1000.00 payment if that suits someone better,  that would be just fine.  Probably better in the long run.  My fingers are crossed, I have until December to move this debt.  My daughter's next semester tuition is in a CD, so that is not a factor.  Also, I am receiving an award of 7000.00 from a suggestion I made and should receive that sometime in October.  That has been allocated for this debt also.  Thanks for thinking of me.

I will have close to $1 million in commitments from corporate 500 companies for the launch and will generate $15 million in five years.   Because of my past connection to the auto industry, i cannot secure bank financing, although I am a disabled Veteran owned small business.   We have invested everything in building this multimedia platform that offers advertisers print, web hub, digital magazines, events, e-newsletters, research and more.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=439935,"My husband and I are considering a purchase of our second residential investment property in Indianapolis.    We currently hold one residential rental property there (zip=46229) through Michelle Ryan Investments, LLC (my husband's LLC, a WA and IN registered LLC).  Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.  We coordinated all aspects of the renovation of the first rental property from right here WA.  The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???  How do we make sure we meet our Lendingclub obligation???  No problem at all.  We own our existing rental house, free and clear.  Because of that, net cash flow from it is more than enough to cover our monthly Lendingclub payment, in case we have to use that source.  As many families lost their precious homes to foreclosure, they are desperately searching for a house to rent.  This has increased the demand for rental houses.  We would like to help a family get a house.  To summarize, you as a Lendingclub lender have a very low risk and have a return that's unbelievably higher than that of banks.  So, please help us help you, everyone!  Please help us help a family that needs our help.  Let's find ourselves in a win-win-win situation!  Thank you for your interest in becoming our lender.

Our clients are all adults who have either a mild intellectual disability or a physical disability. Our job is to assist them so that they can maintain their apartment or home and not have to go into a group home or institutional setting.   We bill 100 percent Medicaid. Once the authorization for services is entered into the system at the State level then we are able to bill for the service. The reason for the loan is to help cover the span of time between when we start working with a new client and when we get paid. The longest the lag has ever been is nine months. The best case scenario is to have a lag of only 2-3 months.   Once authorized our payments come like clockwork. Every two weeks I submit a billing and fifteen days later I get the direct deposit. I just need help in covering the bit of time between providing the service and billing.   Two of my personal credit scores are 713 and 715. I have a long credit history, 1 inquiry in the last 6 months, and nothing negative on my report. No missed payments. The one thing that brings my credit score down is that I put my first year of graduate school on a credit card and I am still working to pay it off.

I have several bank accounts with Valley National Bank in Wayne NJ some of which I have had over 15 years.  In that time I have had 3 personal loans and 1 auto loan.  All 4 loans were paid off early.  I bought a house in Midland Park with my brother in May of 2007.  The mortgage is $2900 a month.  I pay 50% and my brother pays 50%.  I contacted Valley about a personal loan for the engagement ring and they say that my 88,000.00 annual gross income doesn't cover my $2900 a month mortgage.  I explained to them that I only pay $1400 a month because I split the payment with my brother.  My brother and I both have Valley National Bank.  Valley can see we have a joint account for the last 2 -1/2 years that we both contribute equally and house expenses get deducted from this account.  Valley says that they need a cosigner on the loan because they can not assume that I split the mortgage even though they can plainly see we do split.  I would consider asking my brother or another family member to cosign on a Valley loan but I do not want anyone knowing my intentions to propose.  I am in a bit of a bind.  I need a personal loan for $6000.00 without any penalties for paying off early.  I also want it directly deducted from my checking account monthly.

Over time, the same thing happened with several more credit cards until I woke up one day and realized I was living beyond my means.   Fast forword a decade and things are much better. I own my car free and clear and purchased a home several years ago. I've held a steady job for many years with the same school district I graduated from long ago. Alas, the credit card debt from my youth is still around to haunt me.   I'm looking to consolidate my remaining credit card balances into one sum, with a lower APR, thus allowing me to make one payment rather than several.   I've never been late on a payment, credit card or otherwise, and I've learned the hard way about money management. Ideally I would have taken out a Home Equity loan to consolidate my debt, however the recent housing conditions and lower reappraised value of my home have not allowed me this option.   Thank you.

My husband of 11 years and I, are hoping to build a pool in our backyard to enjoy with friends and our two children in this warm climate.  Two years ago, we moved to Arizona from Washington state with a new job, and we love it!  We purchased a home and decided to stay, but now wish we had purchased a home with a pool--something usually secured by your property--and those loans are now few and far between.  We are slightly upside down on our home, so selling and repurchasing a home with a pool isn't a great option for us right now.    We have researched several pool builders and have narrowed it down to two. We would love to take advantage of the end of summer pool discounts offered by pool builders, as we are approaching the slow time of year for new pool builds.  Our current household income is roughly $120,000.  Approximately $7000 is my part time job working at our children's school, and the remainder is my husband's income working for a major telephone service provider.  We are honest, hardworking, taxpaying idividuals who are more than willing to work hard to get ahead.  We currently contribute more than 15% of our income into our retirement accounts, give to charity on a regular basis and have money set aside for emergencies.

This loan will allow me to reserve the rights to build a second location for an MD Assisted Weight Loss franchise. I opened my first location 90 days ago (in Charleston, SC) and have been virtually sold out since Day 1. I have a group of investors for my first location and we are Cash Flow Positive this month - but cannot take money out of the business yet. Given that I have proven the profit potential of this business by rapidly getting to cash flow positive and creating a growing patient base of satisfied patients - I need additional capital immediately to lock up a second highly desirable market (based on demographics) where I have valuable contacts. Time is of the essence because there are a few folks evaluating that market and considering claiming the rights to develop it. In terms of loan alternatives - the market for unsecured credit lines is very tight right now, my Home's LTV is greater than 80% therefore a Home Equity Loan is not available and gaining an advance on our business' Credit Card transactions is far too expensive - therefore I figured I would try peer-to-peer lending and simply pass through the lending costs to my LLC.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I earn +$400k W2'd income per year outside of this business, my employment and income are stable, I have one franchise location (where I am the 55% Majority Owner) that will be generating +$10k per month starting 4Q2009, and I have never been sued, arrested nor have I ever defaulted on any financial obligation in my life.

He left me with an enormous amount of debt. However, since his passing in 1999, I have purchased 2 homes.   I am hoping that you will grant me this personal loan. None of my credit accounts (including my home) have been paid late. I have just let this debt get out of control and need to eliminate it all together.

I ended up staying four days, most of which was not covered by insurance.  A week later I ended up back in the hospital with complications from the medication and treatment.  I have to attend doctors' visits every other week, each visit incurring another fee.    The hospital requested I make the payment all at once so it's ending up on my credit card.  Now the credit card company wants a lump payment.  I've never missed a payment on my cards or past loans and I've never been late.  I have a secure job and work 40+ hours a week.

There are grant programs and special urban redevelopment loans that help people in my position, but I make too much money to qualify.  The amount I am seeking is only a part of the down payment I would like to offer, and honestly, I could probably wait just a few months and save it.  But every month I wait, I am paying rent that is almost twice what my modest mortgage payment would be.  So, taking out this small loan to help this deal go through will end up saving money.

We ended up breaking up and now I pay for it myself. Thing is, I dont need a car that expensive, and I can't sell it to a private party because I make payments in it and I can't get the title until the car is paid off. You can't sell a car to a private party unless you hold the title.  I could sell to a dealer but they will pay me 6000 less than what I owe in the car so that is completely out of question. I owe $20300 in the car, a dealer would give me 14k and I can sell it to a private party for 19 or 20k.  Therefore, the purpuse of this loan is so that I can pay off my car, so I can get the title and sell it to a private party. Then I would use the sale money, whenever it sells, to buy a much cheaper car (I was thinking something like 5k) and use the rest as a down payment in a house I wanna buy.   The other option I would have to stop wasting money in this car is to have someone take over my car payments and just transfer the title to that person when the car is paid off. I find that very risky because the car would still me under my name and responsability and if the person doesnt make my payment in time it would affect my credit negatively when I am trying to buy a house.  I have never paid any bills late and I wouldn't let someone one do that with my name and credit. Not to mention the damage that can be done to the car and all things that can go wrong with that option.  I am a great candidate for this loan because I am an extremely honest and responsable person. I pay all my bills at least a week before their due date, always on time, and I always pay them until they are paid off.

Ofcourse, CMU wasn't cheap and to fund my education I took an education loan from India totaling about $70,000.  I graduated about 12 months back and secured a top job at a substantial salary. Other than my education loan, I have zero debt (currently utilizing a zero percent balance transfer offer on one credit card -- close to zero debt on my three other cards). My first year income was about $95,000. Due to my low debt obligations, I went all out to repay my education loan, paying in as much as $55,000 dollars in one year (I have bank statements to show the money returned). However, as most of my payments were in the beginning of last year (when the dollar was much weaker), the conversion rate was against me and I didnt return as many rupees as I borrowed.   I have about $15,000 left on my loan and am far ahead of my required payments. However, there are two big reasons I want to close out my loan immediately:  1) Education loans in India are very expensive and I am currently paying about 15% in interest.   2) Due to recent run up of the dollar, the exchange rate with the rupee is at its highest (nearly 25% higher when compared to one year ago). Not sure how long this might last.  To capitalize on this, I am looking to borrow money to close out my loan in India immediately and handle everything here in America. This reduces my forex exposure and offers lower interest rates. Hence, I am motivated to move this debt to America and pay in the currency I earn in. I am sincere, hard working, have a great job, and excited about future possibilities post clearing this loan in India! Thanks for reading my note!

The loan will also help with the first few monthly payments until we have all 4 patients.  Revenue for this start-up will be split among 2 sources: patient's social security payments and patient's out of pocket payments (sometimes paid for by the patient's family members).  Based on conservative financial projections, it is estimated that positive cash flow will occur starting in month 7 and the overall break-even will occur at about month 15.

I am part owner in a seasonal food vending business at the MN State Fair. We have been in business for 11 years now and every year our sales have gone up. We are in again in 2009. This is NOT a business loan, it is for me personally. I tell you about the Seasonal business as that is how I plan on paying off the remaining balance of this loan come Sept, which is right after our event. I am fully confident in this again as we have been in business for 11 years.   I am also employed full time at the same company for  21 years. I am in a level 2 leadership position. I have a good credit rating, a FICO score above 700 and am a responsible person. I have simply fell behind financially over the last few months. I am also current on my bills and plan on keeping it that way.   Thus the reason for this loan is to help me keep afloat between now and September. This will allow me to stay current on my loans and also provide for my family. Last year I put more money against some debt and am making good progress where I can see I should have saved more for living expenses. Though it did feel very good to pay of some of that revolving credit. :)   Securing this loan will allow me to stay current on my bills while also being able to better provide for my kids.

I am a reliable payer and have no late payments in my credit history.    I am seeking to consolidate my debt because I paid for some graduate school expenses with my credit cards, as well as utilizing a higher interest personal loan.  Due to the current financial economy, I was not able to obtain a student loan.   I usually obtain my student loans through TERI, which is currently in reorganization and is not accepting new loans.   I go to law school part time in the evening (don't hold this against me for those of you who may not be fond of lawyers) and work full time as a senior business analyst.     I will be consolidating the personal loan, as well as some credit card debt.  The payment of this loan ($378) will be lower than what I am currently paying for these debts ($294 for the loan, $75/month for two different credit cards that I plan to pay off).   In addition, the interest rate on this loan is lower than all rates on these three items.   Thank-you for your consideration - again, I have no late payments or any other negative credit history.  My only issue is that I have high revolving debt because I paid for some education expenses using credit.    I appreciate your consideration.

This money will cover all marketing, training, business cards, a website set up and all advertising that is professionally done by the company.   I have a full time job as a business finance consultant. This occupation has lent itself to my ability to start my company - having over 15 years experience in this industry. My franchise business will be both real estate investment and finance consulting. In the finance consulting part I assist small to medium sized business owners obtain funding by partnering with an established commercial business finance company that has in-house underwriting and the ability to fund deals directly or use a connected lending source. These deals have a minimum average amount of $1.5M with a 1.5% fee per loan which is split with the franchise. In the real estate investment part I acquire and renovate income producing properties.  These properties are purchased at a low entry value (under appraised value) - usually no more than 65% acquisition. These properties are then stabilized and provide affordable housing, often with the  option of government subsidized rentals which is guaranteed rental income.   I am a good financial risk for this loan because my business dealings provide my business with high cash returns on low entry business opportunities. I am highly experienced in lead generation of qualified business owners in need of financing as my W-2 job is as a commercial lead pre-qualifier/originator for an out-of-state commercial lender. Over the past year I have averaged on a monthly basis leads totaling refinance amounts in excess of $5M (with a 70% closing ratio).

My family has been in the retail industry since 1975. We sell low-cost, high-profit margin items such as basic work clothing, evening-wear, resort-wear, and cruise-wear.  Additionally, we sell silver, amber, larimar, and other low-cost jewelry.  Our profit margins are generally greater than 15% based on the cost of goods sold.   I also have a full-time job as a senior technology consultant for a prestigious consulting firm and make over $80,000 annually with a minimum 7% bonus.  I also have 3 investment properties with LTV ratios well below 80% and I have a positive net cash flow of $600/month.  My gross rental income is $3120/month with grade A tenants.  Our business has well-established, long-standing relationships with local banks.  Currently, we are comparing our options between peer-to-peer lenders and local banks.  Due to the tight credit market, the fees, interest rates, and points are a bit too high at local banks.  The loan would be used to finance the purchase of inventory and will more than likely be paid off early. Therefore, we thought lending club might be a better fit.  With that in mind, below is a breakdown of our income statement from FY' 07:  Revenue:....... $627,300.00  COGS:............ $(319,923.00) ------------------------------------ Gross Margin:..$307,377.00  ------------------------------------ Rent:.............. $(65,400.00) Salary:........... $(96,000.00) Utilities:..........$(29,100.00) Insurance:..... $(48,000.00) ----------------------------------- Total Exp:...... $(238,500.00) ------------------------------------ Op.

Our vehicles were paid in full, we had money in the bank and we funded our 401k(s).  We are trying to pay off each card, one at a time, but the interest rates on some are 25 percent.  We would like to pay off our high interest rate cards and combine them into one structured payment.  We would close or have the card limits reduced once they are paid.  We have recently tried to transfer balances to other low interest cards, so I believe this may have cause our credit score to lower a bit.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=360327,"I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",small_business,Partnership Bridge Loan,220xx,VA,15.16,0,May-87,680,684,0,33,,8,0,134025,67.90%,16,f,0,0,24214.71803,12125.27,20000,4214.72,0,0,0,11-Jul,611.71,11-Aug,15-Aug,634,630,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,0,0

I have worked hard to repair the damage I did to my credit score in college. I began a new job 4 months ago with higher pay and I just want to completely eliminate as much of this debt as possible. I can pay my debts, I would just like to pay them off faster and pay less interest. My college loans are locked in at a VERY low interest rate (2.88%). I have no problems at all with my college loans, I just want to bring down my interest payments on my high interest credit cards & loans. I work in healthcare, an industry that will not be affected as much by the economic troubles that the country has.

I also hold a degree in engineering from one of the nationâ€™s top universities. The CQF is equivalent to a Master's in Financial Engineering.  I have been admitted to the program and have made the first 2 payments of $2,858.00. My remaining balance is $11,432.00. I am seeking a loan of $4,500.00 as the remaining balance will be financed elsewhere.   Sallie Mae and other providers (FASFA) have specialized career training loans; unfortunately, the training program must be based out of the USA to be eligible for funding. The CQF is provided by 7City Learning LTD based out of London, UK. Thus the piecewise funding.  50% of the delegates attend the course in London.

Those of you who are not familiar with the Baker University program, students are able to finish their core degree requirements on a flexible schedule (1 class at a time) that caters towards working professionals.  However, since I went into the program with 32 hours of electives still to take. When my program concludes in May, 2009, I will still be left with 32 hours of credits to take before I officially receive my business degree. Thatâ€™s why I have opted to finish up these elective credits at my local community college over the next two semesters.

It's a 25.9% interest and I've been making payments for two years, more than the minimum, on time--every one, yet my balance is not going down at all. I owe around $3,500 on that. I've contacted them and asked them to lower the interest rate and unfortunately they're one of the few lenders who absolutely refuse to do that--they'll only consider it once the account has been paid in full.   I want to use the other $3,500 to refinance other credit I have to lower my monthly bills, so I can attack debt easier by slowly, but safely chipping away at higher interest rates until its paid off. I plan on being debt free in 3 years.   I work most weekends out of choice (in addition to my 40-hour a week job), to give me extra money to spend on debt. I know that sounds odd, but its helping me repay my debts much quicker...and helping me pay moer than just the minimum.  Rather than using this money to create more debt, I am using it to repay my current obligations and be debt free.  I have very good credit, and have never missed a payment on any account I've ever had. I'm not a risk for borrowers--I've lived in the same place for 22 years. I've had a very steady job for the last 5 years.   The benefit of funding this loan is you will get a constant return on your investment, and I will not default, as I've shown in my excellent payment history and you (while getting a great return) will assist me in eliminating debt.

Purpose of loan: Payoff highest-rate credit card debt, which is currently 28-31.5%.  Getting another loan with a lower interest rate will improve my monthly cashflow.  My progress:  Today I have 14 credit lines with a revolving credit balance of 150K and utilization of 99% (result of recently paying down 2 CC accounts anc closing them).   My financial situation:  I have accumulated too much credit card debt and continue to work to pay it all off.  I have a perfect payback history: no missed payments or delinquent accounts.  My payback history in my credit files is perfect, but I have let some credit card rates get too high by some inattention on my part.  I opened some credit cards with low introductory rates on balance transfers but because I was late on a couple of the payments by literally 1-3 days, the credit card companies jacked up the rates.  Those initial low interest rate offers (e.g., 0 to 3.99% for 12 months) for balance transfers were tempting, but came back to haunt me.  My credit rating/score looks poor becasue of my high percent of borrowing vs. limit.  I've always paid back and will continue to.  I have no delinquencies or negatives on my credit reports and I'm committed to it staying that way.  Any form of negative mark on my credit report is not an option for me.  If my loan is funded, I will immediately pay down my highest interest debt .

I started selling and financing mobile homes in May.  Basically I buy the homes cheap for cash and resell the home on a promissory note.  Since I started I've sold 5 homes - three on notes and two for cash.  I screen buyers for credit and employment history.  Generally I can buy a mobile home for around $2000 and sell that home for $7000.  I require at least 10% down and payments of $250-$300 per month.  My notes generally are 36 months â€“ the same as this loan.  Currently I have a list of 11 buyers waiting for me to find homes for them to buy.  The homes are available to buy, but I'm low on cash.  We initially invested $15,000 into this business.  Right now the business has $5,000 cash (already committed to buying new homes) and notes totalling $24,600.  This is a GREAT business.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because the business currently has notes generating $928 per month.  The $20,000 I'm asking for here will buy up to 10 additional homes.  Those homes will generate an additional income of around $2,500 per month or more.  The business is currently making enough money to service this debt.  Additional funds are to increase profits. Outside of the business my wife and I have full time jobs and we bring home $72,000 per year.  We also have two rentals - one brings in $2150 per month and the other brings $675.  Our gross after tax monthly income from all sources is $9800.  We have no kids.  We are financially disciplined and we don't spend a lot of money despite our high income.  Just about all of our consumer debt is money that we've borrowed for investments.  We have only about $2000 in credit card debt that is not for investments.  My wife and I both work full time, we each run a small business, and we operate 2 rental properties with 7 tenants total.

The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal "you give me money, I say thanks and make payments" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctorâ€™s bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and Iâ€™ve never missed a payment on anything.""bout me: I'm a young, ambitious, and excited student, father and future husband. The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal "you give me money, I say thanks and make payments" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them.

I am a 29 year old working professional determined to pay down my credit card debt at a lower interest rate.  In my early twenties, I tried to make ends meet by using my credit cards. I now see that cutting my expenses and only buying things I can afford are what enable me to make ends meet and have money remaining.   My use for this loan will be for the sole purpose of paying off my credit cards and having one monthly payment for this loan. My DTL ratio is high due to my credit card balances, but I pay my bills on time. Once I have paid my loan back in full, I will begin saving for my first home. Yay!  I am college graduate employed full time with a stable company. By living with a relative, I have been able to save a great deal of money with a below-market rent payment and shared utilities. In addition, I may also sell my car (a VW). I have no children/dependents and only support myself.  Thanks so much for reading. I am looking forward to my debt-free future.

I was looking at a debt calculator, and realized it would take me years..even decades to pay off the cards, and ending up having to pay so much extra money in interest in that time.  WHY would I do that when I can hopefully get a loan, pay just about what I am paying now, and be done with it in 3 years.   I understand my credit grade below doesn't look like I am a good risk.  I have discussed my scores and why I received this grade with a finance counselor - it is  because of my debt ratio/usage of credit accounts.  My payment history and age of accounts scored an A.  I understand the value of good credit - which is why you are reading thsi now. I can and WILL payback on time.. something you hopefully soon find out :)  I have been employed at the same company in the Bay Area for 7 years (in May).  It's a great job - one which I have no plans on leaving.  I opted not to list the name of the company on my profile, but would be willing to share if you were to contact me.

In an incredibly expensive city! Because I always paid promptly, the credit card companies kept increasing my line of credit and so on and so forth until I was in over my head.

My wife Karen just returned to her full time teaching position within our public schools of 13 years. She was in a shared position for the last 4 years so she could be home with our 3 kids (that are all under 5) and the days she worked I kept the kids. In that time she finished her Phd, reared 3 kids for 18 months each, now is obtaining her administration certificate & national board certification. I am fortunate enough to work from home plus I have 2 local offices. We need a loan to offset costs from not only education but the very expensive preschool. We have good credit (I was 729 just last week) and typically good income. Never had major defaults, never anything major at all. With me being self employed it is tougher to get a loan even though I have had my business for 9 years, 6 of which with the same firm. My wife just returned (in Sept) to full time work, we had several years of intented reduced income but we made good investments and am able to live comfortably. That time at home was priceless and worth every penny and sacrifice! We have retirement, mutual funds, college savings plans for the 3 kids, substantial life insurance (perm & term) but we don;t want to touch them. We have supportive families however elect not to go that route. We own lots of real estate. All have equity available. The 2nd biggest reason for this loan is to replinish what we spent to SAVE one of our properties. My wife inherited a farm house that has been in the family for 5 generations. In order to get the deed we agreed never to sell the property (must go to our kids) and we will not use the property for collateral or borrow against it. It was broken into and then abandoned 20+ years ago after Karen's grandmothers death. It was in disrepair. Karen's mom has been battleing cancer for quite a while. Both her parents are aging so we decided to RESCUE the house & outbuildings, fix them up, and hold a surprise Christmas dinner there for her family. We did it! Now we have a nice farmette on 6 acres that we own free and clear - no leins - and are using it. It's value is $300,000+. We also own 2 resort waterfront properties that have substantial equity in them however because they are worth 1.2 million, combined, 2 props deeded as 1, it is hard to obtain a loan using typical mortgages due to secondary market conditions and requirments. That property is planned to be vacation & special event rentals this year but until then it is a second home. We have little unsecured debt. Several credit cards have zero or low balances but 2 are higher and need to be consolidated. Our family Volvo is owned free and clear, my truck only has 18 months left to pay on it, and we have a Nissan Van lease that is up in 4 months. We own 5 boats, 4 of which are owned free and clear. 1 has a balance of about 7k. We have a newer HELOC for 88k used for the fix up that if someone is interested we would like to re-do so we can sell the other property that it is attached to. For now we can really use this 25k to consolidate existing debts, get my wife through these last few professional certifications, and allow me to finish my West VA realtor's license (weeks away) to expand my business. What is left I plan to pamper my wife with a small trip and mini makeover! After years of growing it, she wishes to donate her hair to locks of love. I think she has enough for 1 1/2 childrens wigs. Please help! I read about this program and it sounded perfect for our needs. This is simply brilliant! Plus we intend to do the same for other people as soon as preschool is done! I have NOT been denied for any other loans. I have not applied recently for any other loans. If it helps I am also an Eagle Scout!

I have been married for the past 7 years and have 3 wonderful children.  I obtained a BA in Information Systems and recently obtained a good paying job.  Other than hanging with my family I enjoy racing motocross with my son and working out.  Credit situation: Back in 2000 I filed for Chap. 7 Bankruptcy because I was young and not aware of how credit worked back then.  Since then I have been very responsible and have been  rebuilding my credit.  I have never been late on any payments.  Purpose of loan: The purpose of this loan will be to consolidate  2 outstanding loans that have interest rates of 25% and one credit card with a balance of $600.  Budget: I will be repaying this loan back with my paychecks each month.  Currently I bring home around $5200 per month.  My monthly expenses are around $4400, so paying this back will not be a problem.  I just want to lower my interest rate on my loan. Please see below for budget layout.  Monthly net income: $ 5100  Monthly expenses: $ 4355   Housing: $ 1100  Insurance: $ 105   Car expenses: $ 650   Utilities: $ 200   Phone, cable, internet: $ 120  Food, entertainment: $ 900   Credit cards and other loans: $ 930   Other expenses: $ 350  Closing: If you invest in me I can guarantee that I will be a good investment, as I said I am a very responsible family man that always pays his bills.

My brand new wife and I are spending our time getting our financial future set up and combined together.  Recently we have been looking into P2P as a neat way to invest, this loan would be to get started doing just that.     We have been living together for over a year and have quite an extensive income, but since we have combined our debt and I can only count my income, my DTI looks high.  With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.  I earn approximately $10500 a month and my wife brings home another $3300 so you don't have any concerns about getting your money back if someone defaults on me.   Good Bidding!

We started looking a ServiceMagic.com and found it to be way to expensive and the leads where given not just to him but every contractor in the area. So by the time he called around the customer was just aggravated from to many calls. I took upon a task to built him a simple website that would get him the leads, but we notice this was not making any progress so i started to research how internet works and found google, yahoo and msn have great marketing and advertising tools that help out small business but although it was effective we found it to be expensive. I then realized a term called SEO/SEM (Search Engine Optimization/Search Engine Marketing) six months later after a few classes and plenty of research and books i was able get him top rankings for contractors in his area of business, best of all the website was getting natural ads in google, yahoo and msn top ten ads on those three search engines is tuff you not only need to be established but you have to be loud on the internet!! So we did it and he started getting his first 1-3calls a day then we turned to 5-10 and now we get roughly 7-15 calls but my avg is 7 calls during winter season when trees, fences and roofs have plenty of accidents and problems. We have yet to experience a summer but i could only imagine. My uncle and i agreed $10.00 a call was fair weather or not the job got done. He then referred a friend of his with a Janitorial Company and the model works for his business as well, so i decide to offer this great tool to other small business in the area. A bit hesitant to the new idea a lot of business turned me down but that didn't stop my persistence, so i offered the service Free for the first month. Yes I told them i would help your business succeed as long as you give me the chance to show you what i could do. After adding 4 more clients i found myself, not only creating and maintaining the websites but also doing the marking  on a daily basis for all 6 clients this included taking the initial call, tracking the calls, invoicing my clients, and lots of other business administration stuff that took a regular 12-15hr days after six months i noticed my health and wife were really getting sick of a workaholic so, I recently started looking for software that would do most of the marketing for me and i also found a outsourcing company that would take the calls, track the calls and best yet invoice my clients. I also need to higher a accountant, My focus will be in getting more clients and i found that to be easy with my 30 day free trial period with no risk to a small business. This loan will go along way and i am currently taking Video classes to help our clients get there message across to there customers.  best wishes to all,   ",small_business,looking foward to expand ,958xx,CA,8.8,1,Feb-00,675,679,4,19,0,10,0,8045,49.70%,22,f,0,0,5208.49,3430.47,3399.8,1423.35,0,385.34,4.02,9-Feb,402.56,9-Oct,16-Oct,594,590,0,1,INDIVIDUAL,0,0,0,,0

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.  Thank you in advance for reading this and helping me with this project.     Monthly net income: $ 7,900  Monthly expenses:    Housing: $ 1.825   Insurance: $ 120   Car expenses: $600    Utilities: $ 55   Phone, cable, internet: $40    Food, entertainment: $ 200   Clothing, household expenses $250    Credit cards and other loans: $ 1000   Other expenses: $ 400  Excess income over expenses = $3,410 This will be more than enough to both pay the loan and leave some for savings and emergencies.

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled.

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have spent the last several years cleaning up my credit and will not allow myself to go anywhere but forward at this point. I have a come a long way in building up my credit worthiness.  The sole cause of my past credit problems is due to mistakes I made years ago involving my student loans (listed as seven different accounts on my credit report because they're broken down by semester). A few years back, after falling way behind in my payments, I worked out a restructuring deal with the supplier of these student loans. They brought my account current and I have since had one simple payment per month. I have never been late in these payments, and this has allowed me to slowly watch my credit health improve as time treks on. I am very proud of this.  The other three active debt accounts listed on my credit report are two credit cards and a computer loan, with a combined total owed of $3200. These accounts, as mentioned above, will be completely eliminated with this Prosper loan.   I have been employed with the same company for four years now, and job security is no concern. However, I make less in the slower winter months than in the spring, summer and fall. This is the reason for the cusion mentioned above. Although I usually have more cash saved for these slow months, I have overextended myself a bit by sending in higher-than-required student loan payments this year.   I have a lot to look forward to in my life. I have been blessed in 2007, having met the girl I hope to spend many wonderful years with.

We never intended to get into so much debt, but over the past four years, we've sunk deeper and deeper. First, my wife was laid off two weeks before Christmas. During that same week, our only car died, and we got a $300 gas bill. So we lived off of a line of credit. Then, I was laid off, so we lived off of a credit card. As the bills piled up, we kept relying on our credit to buy necessities.   Now we're both working again, but it doesn't seem to be enough. One of our interest rates is over 19%, and it's killing us. We pay everything on time, and usually much more than the minimum payment. Consolidating our three credit payments will help us get out of debt faster than continuing to pay the credit card companies.  Between the two of us, we take home roughly $4000 a month. After the utilities, house payment and other bills, we will have roughly $500 a month to pay towards this loan.  Getting out of debt would mean being able to add to our family. Getting out of debt would mean buying a house of our own instead of splitting one with my mom. Getting out of debt would mean everything to us- help out this young family!

The firm currently works with 1 developer I referred and I have passed along 3 more in the last week. The second component involves selling the current inventory of mortgage loans the origination company carries and services. I have negotiated a broker fee of $75,000 for the sale of a $5M portfolio. I have a commitment to purchase that requires an SEC filing for securitizing the portfolio (attorney's fees required), negotiating the final purchase price (travel required), and generating the final agreement in legal form to complete the transaction (attorney's fees required).  The second contract was agreed upon today and provides me with a $100,000 fee for procuring funding for a custom home development. On November 16 the contract will be signed and a $10,000 escrow deposit made to secure the contract. I then have 90 days to procure the funding. I already have 2 investor groups interested and am setting up presentation meetings with those groups for sometime in early December. I am responsible for developing the investor presentation, coordinating the date/time for the presentation including booking the meeting room (travel required as well), and generating the final agreement (attorney's fees required).

We had a lot of mold damage (from tremendous water leakage). Unfortunately, insurance does not cover mold damage in Florida any longer. As a result, we went through our savings and used a lot of credit to repair our home. I had never been through anything quite so devasting and have developed a real sympathy for anyone facing a disaster! We lost so much that can never be replaced.   A lot of the repairs we did ourselves to save money but certain things we were not qualified to do- i.e. electircal, roofing,etc. We have just now this summer gotten a new roof (the waiting lists were over 18 months long). We are now ready to complete the electrical issues, new ceilings and put our house back in order. We are out of money and need help!  I am a local banker who has lived and worked in the community for over 25 years. I am very active in giving back to the community and hope some of that good karma will come back to me now that I need some help. My credit is good- I have no late payments, collections, judgements, cahrgeoffs, etc. My score is not high since I have used a great deal of credit to try to put my home back together, but I ALWAYS pay my bills. I can afford the payment, and am a person of high moral character.   Please let me know if there is any other information that would like to know.

We recently closed on our first home on 8/31/07.  We have four beautiful children.  With the new mortgage (and all the other bills that come with our home), we have found ourselves over our head in debt.  We are in dire need of assistance to maintain the life we have been steadily building for our family. Our income and debt are as follows:  I have been an auto tech for nearly 3 years with the same employer.  This year, I was promoted to manager, which, helped us realize our dream of homeownership.  My wife works part time as a CSR at the same company.   I earn 60k/annually My wife $17k Average Net monthly income: $4500  Our monthly debts:  Mortage $1120.00 Vehichle:$639.00 Credit Card: $100.00 Credit Card: $ 89.00 Short term Personal Loan: $150.00 Short term Personal Loan: $190.00 Car insurance: $125.00 Utilities:  $300.00 Cell Phones: $80.00 Gas: $300.00 Food:$600.00 (with tons of coupons) Daycare: $120/wk  With this loan we intend to pay off the two personal loans.  This will give clear at least $340 a month! This is a big deal to us.  This will be our first step in a series towards reducing our debt.  All of our bills have ALWAYS been paid on time and remain current.  My credit profile is being penalized because I have never had much credit. We are honest, loving, and giving people. We take nothing and no person for granted.  We thank you for any contribution you make. Please feel free to ask us any questions.  Thank you!

Coming from a Portuguez family who really only speaks portuguez I have made my ways through school and made my parents proud of me.  I work hard everyday to acheive my goals of becoming a Nurse. Currently I am working full time as an assistant Nurse. I believe every individual should have goals set in there life because I believe that is what keeps you on track.   Reason For Loan Request: Both my parents were born in Portugal so there English is not so good. They have had rough times getting a job but eventually they both got one. My father is a construction worker and my mom works at A Child Day Care. There income is not that strong but they do what they have to do to get by. They worked hard to pay for me to go through college to get my associates. Now that I have had this assistant Nursing job for over a year now I feel it is time to start paying them back. Along with paying them back I also want to buy a used car so I can stop putting miles and trapping them in the house by using there car. I also want a little helping hand paying for school that will be coming up and books that will be coming up soon.  Closing Remarks: I want to Thank everyone who has taken the time to read my request for a Loan. I can guarentee you 100% that this Loan will be repayed in time and on time. I will not let anyone down and I will definatly not let my self down. Please give me the helping hand on trying to achieve my goal of becoming a Nurse. This Loan will also improve my credit score. As of now I do not mind the high interest rate because I believe anyone out there that has that warm heart to help me out should be rewarded with some profit.
